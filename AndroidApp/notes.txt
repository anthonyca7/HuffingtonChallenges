Part A) I tested the checklist and the tests seemed very fair. However, the tests are better performed by an appropiate automation system. 

Part B) The application shuts down after using it for some time. It is possible that some inner task is taking too much memory as this tends to only happen when the phone memory is low. I could not find any specific feature bug in my phone, Samsung Galaxy S4, the bugs can be present in other android system.
